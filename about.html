<h2>What is OSM</h2>
<p>
Occupancy Simulation Model (OSM) is a software package for the simulation, visualization and 
evaluation of occupancy scenarios. Specifically, it is composed of 
Mandatory Occupancy Scenario Model (MOSM) and Optional Occupancy Scenario Model (OOSM).  
OSM is an under development project that uses an Agent-Based 
Model (ABM) to simulate building occupants and their unique preferences 
as well as a rich 3D model (either BIM or CAD) to represent the built environment.
 From this perspective it is similar to force-based crowd simulation models. The difference is 
that OSM is not concerned with safety and mainly focuses on evaluation 
of occupants&rsquo; experiences during occupancy scenarios. An agent in OSM is also smarter 
that the agents in most crowd simulation models in several ways. Instead of merely trying 
to avoid collisions with barriers and other agents or becoming engaged in rudimentary 
scenarios, in OSM an agent can react to environmental qualities and visual events. An agent 
can also be parametrically tuned to mimic the behavior of a human in real buildings. 
OSM utilizes Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for modeling mandatory occupancy scenarios. After training, 
an agent in OSM can collect information of hours of occupancy scenario. This information 
can then be subjected to visual, sequential and spatial query to create a scientific foundation 
for evaluation and comparison of design alternatives. In summary, OSM can help designers understand the 
impact of their design decisions on the occupants at the post-occupancy phase to make their  
decisions more informed.

OSM also offers functionalities for visibility analysis including efficient calculation 
of polygonal and cellular visibility fields (i.e. isovists) from vantage points, 
calculation of visibility area from specified areas, proxemics analysis, and extraction of Justified Graphs (JG) 
in a semi-automatic way. However, OSM <i>should not be considered</i> 
as an alternative to existing Space Syntax software such as Depthmap. Space Syntax is based on a general
 theoretical foundation to predict how people walk in space whereas OSM uses a physically-based simulation which is 
 inherited from crowd simulation models.
It also provides a mechanisms for saving and loading spatial data in CSV format. 
With OSM, occupancy scenarios can be animated and spatial data can be visualized in both 
2 and 3 dimensions.

OSM was developed purely in C# programming language. Its programming logic is based on complete separation of 
simulation engine from visualization engine, which is developed in XAML format using 
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The source-code is available from 
<a href="https://github.com/zarrinmehr/OccupancySimulationModel">GitHub</a>
under <a href="https://github.com/zarrinmehr/OccupancySimulationModel/blob/master/LICENSE"> MIT License</a>. 
OSM lays out a fully interoperable framework 
with BIM and CAD software that can be achieved with providing implementation for an interface 
and an abstract class. The existing source-code provides examples of their implementations 
for Autodesk Revit 2017 using its API libraries and can be directly used.

This software was developed as a part of Ph.D. dissertation of 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saied-zarrinmehr-8b799557/">Saied Zarrinmehr</a>
in the Department of Architecture at Texas A&M University. This project was not 
supported/sponsored by any external funding. 
OSM was developed with the intellectual support of the following colleagues 
of mine at<a href="http://bim-sim.org/"> BIMSIM Group</a> in the Ph.D. Program of 
Architecture and Master's program of Computer Science.
